# Database Schema (Planning Stub)

This planning document no longer includes a full schema definition. The authoritative schema reference now lives in the developer documentation:

- [Master Database Schema](../developer/DATABASE_SCHEMA_MASTER.md)

## What This File Covers
- High-level planning intent only
- Links to phase planning and implementation notes

## Where To Look
- Current schema and model definitions: [Master Database Schema](../developer/DATABASE_SCHEMA_MASTER.md)
- Phase sequencing: [PHASE_PLAN.md](PHASE_PLAN.md)
- Migration guidance: [SCHEMA_MIGRATION_PLAN.md](../developer/SCHEMA_MIGRATION_PLAN.md)
