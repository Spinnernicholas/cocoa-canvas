# Geocoding Job Docs (Moved)

This legacy page is retained as a pointer.

Use these canonical pages instead:

- [Geocoding Job Flow](/developer/job-system/geocoding-flow/)
- [Job Lifecycle & States](/developer/job-system/lifecycle-and-states/)
- [Job API Reference](/developer/job-system/api-reference/)

Important:
- Use the geocoding contract in [Jobs API](/developer/api-reference/jobs/).
