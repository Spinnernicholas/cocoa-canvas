# Contributing

Thanks for contributing to Cocoa Canvas.

## Areas

- Product/application code (`cocoa-canvas/`)
- Documentation site (`docs-site/`)

## Start Here

- [Code Contribution Workflow](./code-workflow/)
- [Docs Site Guidelines](./docs-guidelines/)

## Ground Rules

- Keep changes focused and minimal.
- Prefer source-of-truth behavior from code over stale docs.
- Update relevant docs when behavior changes.
- Keep API interaction details in [Developer API Reference](/developer/api-reference/).
